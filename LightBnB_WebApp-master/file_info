public 

contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. We're not really interested in that right now.

sass 

contains all of the sass files. Again, not really interesting right now.


server 

contains all of the server side code. This is where we will be writing the database queries.

INSIDE SERVER DIRECTORY:

server.js is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
apiRoutes.js and userRoutes.js are responsible for any HTTP requests to /users/something or /api/something.
json is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in .json files.
database.js is responsible for all queries to the database. It doesn't currently connect to any database, all it does is return data from .json files.
We will have to modify the database.js file to have it make queries to our PostgreSQL database instead of JSON files.
